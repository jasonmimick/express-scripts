Flow 1 - Clinical Data Alerts

	HL7 Input -> Pull Relevant Clinical Data -> Run Rule -> Send Alert

Rule - Diabetes Alert - checks if 100 < LDL Level <= 150
						          is diabetic
								  NOT on Statin

Package: exp.Samples.ClinicalAlerts
1. Need a bunch of HL7, generated for 2-3 different patients with ~100 different LDL levels.
2. %Persistent class - exp.Samples.ClinicalAlerts.Patient 	
	> refactor the MedsMonitor.PatientModel.Patient stuff for this
3. Simple transform to pull out patient, clinician and LDL level rule data
. Transform 

How do we know patients are diabetic - we process a real-time hl7 PPR_PC1 2.5:PRB Problem Details HL7 feed - so we need to generate these messages too.
	> also real-time ADT feed to pull diagnosis - > populates "Conditions"

Production - 
	> Inbound HTTP HL7 adapter
	> Message Router - send PPR problem message off to store
					 - send ORU message off to run diabetes rule
	> Business Process
		1. Transform HL7 to DiabetesInfo
		2. Evaluate Rule
			> ?Custom function in Rule - "IsDiabetic"?
			> or poperty on message class? 
				I like the RULE better since it then decouples the logical
				rule from the implementation - the rule user just knows the type
				(PatientModel) and the "condition"
		3. If "Glucose Alert Increase"
		4. Transform to Email - send alert to clinicial
		

Flow 2 - ESI "omission of therapy" alert

Production -
	> Inbound HTTP adapter take PDF
	> Business Process
		1. Extract TEXT from PDF
		2. Rule to extract the clinician info
		3. Attempt to extract info to build CDA document
		4. Send CDA to HealthShare
		5. Transform into Email 
			> Email has ability to respond to confirm/reject alert
			> Record response in HealthShare
	> Data cube to view responses
